# Temperature Converter in Rust

This is a simple temperature converter written in Rust. It converts temperatures between Celsius, Fahrenheit, and Kelvin.

## Note

- I'm still learning Rust, so this is a simple project to help me learn the basics of the language.
- I'm open to feedback and suggestions on how to improve the code.
- I will refactor the code and make more modules to improve the readability (hopefully lol).
